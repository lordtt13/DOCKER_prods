services:
  web:
    build:
      ## specifies where the source files are for the service, in this case this directory
      context: .
      ## specifies which dockerfile to use to create the service
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports: 
      - "3000:3000"
    ## specifies volumes, and what folders to grab / ignore
    volumes:
      ### not specifing a folder:containerFolder argument, explicitly refers to working directory of docker folder
      ### this folder is ignored and not synced via the user of docker volumes
      - /usr/section6/ui/node_modules
      ### this creates a volume reference for the local parent directory
      ### this means any time the local directory is updated, the running docker container is updated with these files too
      - .:/usr
  ## service built created specifically just for npm tests
  ### worth considering for dev environments only
  tests:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ## this is actually not working as intended, known bug with create-react-app and docker
    ## tests are not being watched / re-ran when test files change, might want to revisit this later
